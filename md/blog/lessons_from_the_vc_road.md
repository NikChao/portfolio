## Lessons from the VC road
15 Aug, 2025

---

I've recently had an opportunity to pitch a product to VCs in an effort to raise capital. Whilst I succeeded in securing investment committee (IC) approval with a local fund, I decided not to pursue the idea further. Here are the questions I most commonly got asked and a few tips for each. Success would largely depend on answering all of these confidently. For context here are the pitch deck and site I went into these calls with:

### 1. **What is your product?**

- What does it do?
- What problem does it solve?
- Describe it in a non-technical way (unless they ask).
- Frame the problem in terms of customer pain or missed revenue, not just inefficiency

### 2. **How big is the problem?**

- Think in terms of market size:
    - **TAM** (Total Addressable Market, least important)
    - **SAM** (Serviceable Available Market)
    - **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
- Use back-of-the-napkin logic if needed but be able to justify it. Keep it simple.
- If it's a niche but growing category, highlight trend lines

### 3. **Who is your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)?**

- If it’s someone like you (a founder scratching their own itch), say so.
- Be precise: industry, role, company size, pain point.

### 4. **What is your beachhead / wedge?**

- What vertical are you attacking first?
- What is the compelling reason for this customer to use your product now?
- VCs are *not* easily sold on “efficiency” unless it clearly impacts **top-line revenue** or **sales velocity**
    - Saying “we help companies close deals faster” lands better than “we save time”

### 5. **Why haven’t the big players done this yet?**

- Is it a tech limitation? A business model conflict? Are you early?
- Is the problem beneath their radar or strategically unattractive for them?

### 6. **Has anyone tried this before?**

- If yes, why did they fail? What’s different now?
- If no, why not? Was the timing off? Did the enabling tech not exist?

### 7. **What’s the “pain of absence”?**

- If someone uses the product and switches it off, how soon do they feel it?
- If usage is episodic (e.g. per incident), make sure pricing and market sizing reflects that.
- VCs are wary of “nice to haves”

### 8. **What’s your pricing model?**

- Is it per seat? Per team? Usage-based? One-time license?
- Make sure this lines up with your GTM (go-to-market) and market size assumptions.

### 9. **Why raise VC at all?**

- If you’re not selling now, why not?
- Why not bootstrap?
- Good answers:
    - Access to **portfolio companies** (especially if they match your ICP)
    - **Distribution** help. Enterprise sales is expensive
    - Funding **hiring** or a **product build** (agency or full-time)
- Be specific:
    
    > “We’re raising $750k to build v1 with an agency, hire a GTM lead, and get to $X MRR by Month Y.”
    > 

### 10. **What’s the long-term vision?**

- What could this *become* if it works?
- VCs often need to believe in a path to a $1B+ (> 0.1% of the time for a $1M investment) outcome, however unlikely.
    - That doesn’t mean BS projections. It should be a function of SOM and pricing model.
    - It should be ambitious but not a complete bluff, they sniff that out pretty easily
    - What categories could you expand into? Could this become infra, a platform, or a network effect play?

### 11. **Who’s on your team?**

- VCs look for *complementary skills*. Ideal combo:
    - A technical founder who understands product and GTM
    - A business founder who understands the tech and the user
- If solo, you’ll likely be asked who you plan to hire first.
- VCs notice changes to this, adding and removing people can lead to some tough questions
